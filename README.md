### Voice-Powered Multilingual Inventory Intelligence for MSMEs

---

## 🚀 Project Description

**Invora** is a multilingual, voice-first mobile inventory management system built for small suppliers, shopkeepers, and warehouse operators.

Traditional inventory apps assume:

* English literacy
* Keyboard input
* Desk-based usage

Invora is different.

It enables suppliers to manage stock using **natural voice commands in Malayalam, Hindi, or English**, powered by AI-driven speech recognition and smart NLP parsing.

> “Inventory management built for the warehouse floor — not the office desk.”
